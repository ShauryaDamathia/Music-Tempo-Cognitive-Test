      <h1>Study Consent Form</h1>
      <p>Research study conducted by Meher Damathia (MSc. Clinical Psychology), Christ University</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this study is to explore the role of music tempo in enhancing cognitive performance in young adults. It will see whether varying tempos of music playing in the background influence cognitive performance, particularly in individuals who experience self-reported attentional difficulties. The findings from this study may contribute to a better understanding of how auditory stimulation influences cognitive efficiency in individuals with attentional challenges, offering potential implications for academic and work environments.
      </p>

      <h3>If you agree to participate:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You will complete a brief questionnaire about your demographic details and attentional experiences.</li>
        <li>You will perform a cognitive task under different music conditions (no music, low tempo, high tempo).</li>
        <li>The study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</li>
        <li>Your responses will be recorded, but your identity will remain anonymous.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h3>
      <p>
        There are no known physiological risks associated with participating in this study. However, you may experience slight mental fatigue, similar to what one might feel after completing a focus-based task. If at any point you feel discomfort or wish to stop, you are free to take a break or withdraw from the study without any consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        While there are no direct benefits to you, your participation will help advance research on how music affects cognitive performance. The findings may contribute to improving focus and productivity strategies in educational and professional settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <p>
        There are no known physical and mental risks involved. However, completing attention-based tasks may cause mild mental fatigue. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, you are free to take a break or withdraw from the study without any consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        All information collected during this study will remain strictly confidential. Your responses will be anonymized, and no personally identifiable information will be shared. The data will be securely stored in a password-protected file and used only for academic research purposes. If you have any concerns about confidentiality, feel free to contact the researchers.
      </p>

      <h3>Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You have the right to:</p>

        <li>Skip any questions you do not wish to answer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There will be no consequences or penalties for withdrawing from the study.</p>

      <h3>Publication of Results</h3>
      <p>
        The results of this study may be published in academic journals or conferences, but your identity will never be disclosed. If you would like a summary of the findings, you may request one from the researcher.
